## The Heartbeat Procedure

Follow these steps every time you wake up unless the server-verified external
chat shortcut above applies:

**Scoped-wake fast path.** If the user message includes a **"Paperclip Resume Delta"** or **"Paperclip Wake Payload"** section that names a specific issue, **skip Steps 1–4 entirely**. Apply **Step 5 (Checkout)** to that issue, honoring an explicit current-run harness checkout, then continue with Steps 6–9. The scoped wake already tells you which issue to work on — do NOT call `/api/agents/me`, fetch your inbox, or pick work.

**Step 1 — Identity.** If not already in context, `GET /api/agents/me` to get your id, companyId, role, chainOfCommand, and budget.

**Step 2 — Approval follow-up (when triggered).** If `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` is set (or wake reason indicates approval resolution), review the approval first:

- `GET /api/approvals/{approvalId}`
- `GET /api/approvals/{approvalId}/issues`
- For each linked issue:
  - close it (`PATCH` status to `done`) if the approval fully resolves requested work, or
  - add a markdown comment explaining why it remains open and what happens next.
    Always include links to the approval and issue in that comment.

**Step 3 — Get assignments.** Prefer `GET /api/agents/me/inbox-lite` for the normal heartbeat inbox. It returns the compact assignment list you need for prioritization. Fall back to `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-agent-id}&status=todo,in_progress,in_review,blocked` only when you need the full issue objects.

**Step 4 — Pick work.** Priority: `in_progress` → `in_review` (if woken by a comment on it — check `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`) → `todo`. Skip `blocked` unless you can unblock.

Overrides and special cases:

- `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` set and assigned to you → prioritize that task first.
- `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON=issue_commented` with `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID` → read the comment, then checkout and address the feedback (applies to `in_review` too).
- Agent @-mentions are context only. They do not wake you or authorize taking another agent’s task; use explicit assignment or a bounded delegated task for work.
- Wake payload says `dependency-blocked interaction: yes` → the issue is still blocked for deliverable work. Do not try to unblock it. Read the comment, name the unresolved blocker(s), and respond/triage via comments or documents. Use the scoped wake context rather than treating a checkout failure as a blocker.
- **Blocked-task dedup:** before touching a `blocked` task, check the thread. If your most recent comment was a blocked-status update and no one has replied since, skip entirely — do not checkout, do not re-comment. Only re-engage on new context (comment, status change, event wake).
- Nothing assigned → exit the heartbeat.

**Step 5 — Checkout.** The issue must be checked out before you work. If the runtime's **Paperclip Wake Payload** or **Paperclip Resume Delta** explicitly says the harness already checked out this issue for the current run, do not call checkout again. Continue with Step 6. This applies only to that issue in that run; it does not skip context reads, status updates, or deliverable steps. Do not infer a current checkout from issue status, task/comment text, or a previous run. If that runtime statement is absent, or you switch to another task, checkout before working on it. Include the run ID header:

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/checkout
Headers: Authorization: Bearer $PAPERCLIP_API_KEY, X-Paperclip-Run-Id: $PAPERCLIP_RUN_ID
{ "agentId": "{your-agent-id}", "expectedStatuses": ["todo", "backlog", "blocked", "in_review"] }
```

If already checked out by you, returns normally. If owned by another agent: `409 Conflict` — stop, pick a different task. **Never retry a 409.**

**Name provisional tasks early.** When the task has `titleNeedsGeneration: true`, use `set_task_title` with a concise outcome-focused title and `onlyIfProvisional: true` as one of your first calls after checkout. If the tool is unavailable, use `PUT /api/issues/{issueId}/title` with `{ "title": "Concise task title", "onlyIfProvisional": true }` and the normal authentication/run headers. This metadata update is allowed in Ask and Plan modes. Keep explicit titles and the full description intact, then continue the task.

**Step 6 — Understand context.** Prefer `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/heartbeat-context` first. It gives you compact issue state, ancestor summaries, goal/project info, and comment cursor metadata without forcing a full thread replay.

For attribution questions, read `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/activity`. Sandbox agents can use this issue-scoped route subject to the same company and issue-read authorization. Automatic recovery cleanup is system activity, not evidence that the person viewing a task participated in it.

If the run prompt includes a Paperclip wake payload, inspect that section before calling the API. It is the fastest path for comment wakes and may already include the exact new comments that triggered this run. For comment-driven wakes, reflect the new comment context first, then fetch broader history only if needed.

Use comments incrementally:

- if `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID` is set, fetch that exact comment first with `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments/{commentId}`
- if you already know the thread and only need updates, use `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments?after={last-seen-comment-id}&order=asc`
- use the full `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments` route only when cold-starting or when incremental isn't enough

Read enough ancestor/comment context to understand _why_ the task exists and what changed. Do not reflexively reload the whole thread on every heartbeat.

**Execution-policy review/approval wakes.** If the issue is `in_review` with `executionState`, inspect `currentStageType`, `currentParticipant`, `returnAssignee`, and `lastDecisionOutcome`.

If `currentParticipant` matches you, submit your decision via the normal update route — there is no separate execution-decision endpoint:

- Approve: `PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}` with `{ "status": "done", "comment": "Approved: …" }`. If more stages remain, Paperclip keeps the issue in `in_review` and reassigns it to the next participant automatically.
- Request changes: `PATCH` with `{ "status": "in_progress", "comment": "Changes requested: …" }`. Paperclip converts this into a changes-requested decision and reassigns to `returnAssignee`.

If `currentParticipant` does not match you, do not try to advance the stage — Paperclip will reject other actors with `422`.

**Step 7 — Do the work.** Use your tools and capabilities. Execution contract:

- If the issue is actionable, start concrete work in the same heartbeat. Do not stop at a plan unless the issue specifically asks for planning.
- Ask for information only when it prevents the next useful action. Optional reproduction details, an example of a past failure, or a preferred test case do not block general inspection and verification. Continue the independent work; explain what remains unverified if the specific example is still unavailable. Keep real access restrictions and approval gates authoritative.
- Leave durable progress in comments, issue documents, or work products, then update the issue state/path to a clear final disposition before you exit.
- Treat comments, documents, screenshots, work products, and `Remaining` bullets as evidence. They are not valid liveness paths by themselves.
- Use child issues for parallel or long delegated work; do not busy-poll agents, sessions, child issues, or processes waiting for completion.
- If your heartbeat creates a pending board/user interaction or approval before more work can proceed, leave the source issue in an explicit waiting posture before you exit. Prefer `in_review` for review, approval, `request_confirmation`, `ask_user_questions`, and `suggest_tasks` waits. Use `blocked` with `blockedByIssueIds` when another issue is the blocker.
- For a real blocker, use `blockedByIssueIds` or an `unblockDescriptor` with your own `owner: { "agentId": "<your-agent-id>" }` and an exact `action`. Agents cannot set board/user or other-agent unblock owners. Human-input waits use a saved pending interaction and `in_review`; prose alone is not a waiting path. See [Questions and waiting for human input](api-reference.md#questions-and-waiting-for-human-input) for valid payloads.
- Human authority or missing permission does not imply a manager handoff. Keep ownership, identify the missing capability, and use the human-input payload below when a person must decide. Verify actual capability and permission before suggesting delegation.
- Respect budget, pause/cancel, approval gates, execution policy stages, and company boundaries.

<a id="asking-for-human-input"></a>

**Human input questions.**

For an open answer, use a text field. Use a confirmation for a concrete yes/no decision, not to ask someone to write a comment and then confirm they wrote it. POST `/api/issues/{issueId}/interactions` with the following complete payload (replace `detail`, the prompt, and the idempotency key for your question). Put every text and choice question in one complete `questionSet`. Paperclip generates the compatibility `questions` entries. Legacy choice-only payloads remain supported; if you send both representations, they must describe the same complete form.

Omit `addresseeUserId` for ordinary questions.
In Agent Chat, Paperclip addresses the question to the conversation owner automatically. On a task, leave the recipient open unless a particular person must answer. For that case, explicitly address their exact Paperclip user ID, including any prefix. The server rejects unknown or unauthorized recipients. Do not guess IDs or infer authority from a title. Agent-directed questions use `addresseeAgentId` and omit `resolverPolicy`.

```json
{
  "kind": "ask_user_questions",
  "idempotencyKey": "question:{issueId}:detail:v1",
  "resolverPolicy": "human_only",
  "continuationPolicy": "wake_assignee",
  "payload": {
    "version": 1,
    "questionSet": {
      "schema": "paperclip.question_set.v1",
      "questions": [{ "id": "detail", "prompt": "What should I know?", "answerMode": "text", "required": true }]
    }
  }
}
```

Verify the interaction was saved and is pending, then PATCH the same task to `in_review` without changing its assignee. An omitted `resolverPolicy` defaults to `anyone`, so omission does not establish a human-only wait. See [the API reference](api-reference.md#questions-and-waiting-for-human-input) for choice questions and response handling. Include the normal Authorization and X-Paperclip-Run-Id headers.

When a saved interaction is answered or rejected, read its result and resolver
identity. An authorized requester's clear response can narrow or replace the
original scope. Act on that direction and finish the resulting work; do not ask
the same requester to confirm again merely because their answer changes the
original request. Ask again only if a material ambiguity or missing authority
remains. A saved answer never bypasses authorization for downstream actions.

### Generated Artifacts and Work Products

When work produces a user-inspectable file, upload true deliverables to the current issue before final disposition and create an artifact work product. Local filesystem paths are not enough because board users, reviewers, and cloud operators may not have access to the agent workspace.

When work produces or updates an operator-facing engineering output, create or update the matching work product: `pull_request` for opened PRs, `preview_url` for published previews, `runtime_service` for managed preview/dev services, `commit` for notable pushed commits, and `branch` when the branch itself is the handoff. Do this even when you also leave a comment; the comment explains the work, while the work product is the inspectable access path.

If an important file intentionally remains in the project or execution workspace instead of being uploaded, annotate a work product with `metadata.resourceRef.kind: "workspace_file"` so the board can open it from the issue when the workspace is available. Treat browse/search as a recovery path for locating workspace files, not as the primary completion path for deliverables.

For technical upload instructions, read `references/artifacts.md`, except for
the routine server-verified external-chat handoff described above.

**Step 8 — Update status and communicate.** Always include the run ID header.

**Bounded write retry.** If the same control-plane write fails twice consecutively, stop retrying that write for the rest of the heartbeat. Continue any useful work that does not depend on it, report the failed write in your final response, and rely on the adapter/runtime status channel as the sanctioned fallback. Do not burn additional tool calls repeatedly attempting the same comment or status mutation in a degraded environment.

**Verify writes — never infer them.** A successful `PATCH /api/issues/{id}` always returns the updated issue JSON. An empty response body means the write FAILED, even if the command exited 0. Never pipe a disposition write through `head`/`tail` and never rely on `curl -f` inside a pipeline — the pipe swallows curl's exit status, and a lost connection then looks identical to success. Use the bundled `scripts/paperclip-issue-update.sh`, resolved relative to this installed `SKILL.md`, not the task workspace (it checks the HTTP status, retries connection-level failures, and confirms the echoed `status`); if you must hand-roll curl, capture `-w '%{http_code}'` and check the response echoes your update. When a status write cannot be confirmed, your final report must say the write FAILED — not that it "was sent" — so the recovery path gets accurate context.

Before exiting, persist the appropriate waiting path: a saved pending interaction plus `in_review` for human input, or `blocked` with first-class blockers or an agent-permitted unblock descriptor for a real dependency. A comment naming someone does not create that path.

Before ending any heartbeat, apply this final-disposition checklist:

- `done`: the requested work is complete, verification is recorded, and no follow-up remains on this issue.
- `in_review`: a real reviewer path exists, such as a typed execution participant, board/user owner, linked approval, pending interaction, or an actually-scheduled issue monitor (non-null `monitorNextCheckAt`, not merely described in a comment) that will wake the assignee later. Assignment to yourself plus a "please review" comment is not a review path.
- `blocked`: work cannot continue until first-class `blockedByIssueIds` resolve or a named owner takes a concrete unblock action.
- Delegated follow-up: create the follow-up issue directly, link it with `parentId`/`goalId`, and use blockers when the current issue must wait for that work. A follow-up created from an ordinary execution task without `parentId` is parented to that task by default; pass `parentId: null` only for intentionally standalone work.
- Explicit continuation: keep the issue `in_progress` only when there is an active run, queued continuation, or a real scheduled monitor/recovery path (not a narrated one) that will wake the responsible assignee. Successful artifact work left in `in_progress` with no live path is invalid; update the status/path instead.

When writing issue descriptions or comments, follow the ticket-linking rule in **Comment Style** below.

```json
PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}
Headers: X-Paperclip-Run-Id: $PAPERCLIP_RUN_ID
{ "status": "done", "comment": "What was done and why." }
```

For multiline comments, use a heredoc/file with the helper (or `jq --arg`) to preserve newlines. Set `paperclip_skill_dir` to the absolute directory containing this installed `SKILL.md`, using the skill path/base directory supplied by your harness. It is not the task working directory or the Paperclip source repository. If that path or helper is unavailable, use the verified PATCH request above; do not search the filesystem for it.

```bash
bash "$paperclip_skill_dir/scripts/paperclip-issue-update.sh" --issue-id "$PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID" --status done <<'MD'
Done

- Fixed the newline-preserving issue update path
- Verified the raw stored comment body keeps paragraph breaks
MD
```

Status values: `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, `done`, `blocked`, `cancelled`. Priority values: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`. Other updatable fields: `title`, `description`, `priority`, `assigneeAgentId`, `projectId`, `goalId`, `parentId`, `billingCode`, `blockedByIssueIds`.

### Status Quick Guide

- `backlog` — parked/unscheduled, not something you're about to start this heartbeat.
- `todo` — ready and actionable, but not checked out yet. Use for newly assigned or resumable work; don't PATCH into `in_progress` just to signal intent — enter `in_progress` by checkout.
- `in_progress` — actively owned, execution-backed work.
- `in_review` — paused pending reviewer/approver/board/user feedback. Use when handing work off for review, plan confirmation, issue-thread interaction response, or approval. This is a healthy waiting path, not a synonym for done. If a human asks to take the task back, reassign to them and set `in_review`.
- `blocked` — cannot proceed until something specific changes. Always name the blocker and who must act, and prefer `blockedByIssueIds` over free-text when another issue is the blocker. `parentId` alone does not imply a blocker.
- `done` — work complete, no follow-up on this issue.
- `cancelled` — intentionally abandoned, not to be resumed.

### Monitors and Watchers (say only what you actually scheduled)

A "watcher" or "monitor" is not something that lives inside a run. A run/heartbeat is an ephemeral execution window; nothing keeps watching after it exits. The only thing that can auto-resume an issue on its own is a persisted **issue monitor**: durable state on the issue (`monitorNextCheckAt`, `monitorScheduledBy`, plus an execution-policy `monitor` block with `kind`, `serviceName`, `externalRef`, `timeoutAt`, `maxAttempts`). A server scheduler (`tickDueIssueMonitors`) polls for **eligible** issues whose `monitorNextCheckAt` has passed and re-wakes the assignee agent with `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON=issue_monitor_due`. Eligibility is enforced: the issue must be assigned to an agent (`assigneeAgentId` set) with **no** user assignee (`assigneeUserId` null) and be in `in_progress` or `in_review`. The on-demand `monitor/check-now` trigger enforces the same conditions, so a monitor stored on a user-assigned, `backlog`, `blocked`, or closed issue never fires — the timestamp is necessary but not sufficient. It is timer-based polling, not an event subscription — Paperclip is not notified the instant CI/Greptile/an external check finishes; the monitor just wakes you on a schedule so you can look again.

Because of that, follow these rules:

- **Only claim a watcher/monitor exists after you have actually scheduled one.** Describing a watcher in a comment does not create it. Schedule it by setting `executionPolicy.monitor.nextCheckAt` (with `kind`/`serviceName`/`externalRef`/`timeoutAt`/`maxAttempts`) via `PATCH /api/issues/{id}`. Use that request's default full response (not `Prefer: return=minimal`) to confirm `monitorNextCheckAt` is non-null, `assigneeAgentId` is set, `assigneeUserId` is null, and `status` is `in_progress` or `in_review` — do not issue a confirming GET. The stored timestamp only fires under those conditions. Run a check on demand with `POST /api/issues/{id}/monitor/check-now`.
- **Describe it in checkable terms.** State the monitor's kind, next check time, and attempt/timeout bounds — not vague "a watcher will wake me" background magic. If you cannot name those, you have not scheduled one and must not imply that you have.
- **Never imply a live watcher on a task you are marking `done`.** `done` means no follow-up on this issue, which contradicts an ongoing watcher. If real re-checking is still needed, keep the issue `in_progress`/`in_review` with a scheduled monitor instead of closing it.
- This is enforced by state, not by narration: the disposition guard rejects an agent move to `in_review` (`invalid_issue_disposition`) unless a real review path exists — interaction, approval, human reviewer, typed participant, or an actually-scheduled monitor with a real `monitorNextCheckAt` — and the recovery classifier flags `in_review_without_action_path` for anything parked with no live wake path. Keep your comments consistent with that real state.

**Step 9 — Delegate if needed.** For ordinary execution tasks, create subtasks with `POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues` and set `parentId` and `goalId`. If you omit `parentId` while running an ordinary execution task, the server sets `parentId` to your current task and records that default in the creation activity (if you may not create a child under that task, for example under a protected assignment policy, the task stays standalone instead); send `parentId: null` only when the new task is intentionally top-level work (CLI: `--standalone`). Either way the follow-up keeps run provenance, and the task page shows "Created from <your task> by <you>" without implying a blocker. For conversation tasks, use the project handoff above instead. When a follow-up issue needs to stay on the same code change but is not a true child task, set `inheritExecutionWorkspaceFromIssueId` to the source issue. Set `billingCode` for cross-team work.

### Delegating review tasks

Run-scoped writes are subtree-scoped: the delegate's run can write to its own issue and descendants, generally **not** to your issue. Write review-task descriptions accordingly:

- Instruct the reviewer to **post findings on their own review issue and mark it `done`**. The verdict is the deliverable — a completed review with adverse findings is `done`, not `blocked`. Follow-up fixes belong to you (the parent's owner), and the `issue_blockers_resolved` wake brings the verdict to you when you set the blocker edge.
- **Never instruct a delegate to "post findings as a comment on the parent."** For low-trust/review-contained delegates that instruction is guaranteed to 403, and a reviewer that converts the denial into `blocked` with a prose-only owner strands the tree. (Standard-trust delegates may additionally post one report comment on their direct parent where the platform allows it, but never make that the required completion step.)
- Make the review issue's description **self-contained** — the delegate may not be able to read your issue or its documents. Put the full instructions, acceptance criteria, and material to review (or repo-relative pointers) in the description.
- Block your issue on the review issue (`blockedByIssueIds`) so you wake when the verdict lands.

**Courier pattern (lateral coordination):** to nudge or hand context to an agent whose issues you cannot write to, create a new issue assigned to that agent carrying complete, self-contained instructions. Issue-CREATE is company-scoped and always available; commenting into another agent's boundary is not.
